## [F1 Race Predictions](https://hseiji.github.io/f1go/)

Machine Learning Model created to predict F1 GP winners based on past performance, qualifying lap times, and historical F1 data.
This model utilizes FastF1 API for historical F1 data (race results, qualifying times, among other metrics).
There are many future improvements that I would like to learn and add to this model.

Expected output example:
```
üèÅ Predicted GP Winner üèÅ
Predicted Lap Times and GP Winner:

  Abbreviation  Q3_seconds  Predicted_LapTime (s)
1          NOR      86.269              93.968200
2          ANT      86.271              93.968200
7          LEC      86.754              94.219445
0          VER      86.204              94.605306
```
